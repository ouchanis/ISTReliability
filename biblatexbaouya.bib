  Abstract                 = {Abstract Deployment of software systems is a complex post-production process that consists in making software available for use and then keeping it operational. It must deal with constraints concerning both the system and the target machine(s), in particular their distribution, heterogeneity and dynamics, and satisfy requirements from different stakeholders. In the context of mobility and openness, deployment must react to the instability of the network of machines (failures, connections, disconnections, variations in the quality of the resources, etc.). Thus, deployment should be an uninterrupted process which also works when software is running and requires adaptiveness in order to continually satisfy the constraints and the requirements. Originally managed â€œby handâ€�, software deployment demands an increasing level of automation and autonomy. This article first provides up-to-date terminology and definitions related to software deployment. Then, it proposes an analytical framework and reviews recent research works on automatic deployment with reference to this framework, and synthesizes the results. The review shows that existing solutions are incomplete, and possibly inefficient or unusable, when distribution, heterogeneity, scalability, dynamics and openness are primary concerns. In particular, they barely support dynamic reactions to unforeseeable events. Additionally, abstraction level and expressiveness at design time are rather limited regarding deployment complexity. },

Strong and weak bisimulation equivalence and simulation pre-orders are covered and are logically characterized in terms of the temporal logics Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) and Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL). Apart from presenting various existing branching-time relations in a uniform manner, this paper presents the following new results: (i) strong simulation for CTMCs, (ii) weak simulation for \{CTMCs\} and DTMCs, (iii) logical characterizations thereof (including weak bisimulation for DTMCs), (iv) a relation between weak bisimulation and weak simulation equivalence, and (v) various connections between equivalences and pre-orders in the continuous- and discrete-time setting. The results are summarized in a branching-time spectrum for \{DTMCs\} and \{CTMCs\} elucidating their semantics as well as their relationship. },

In this paper we describe the Disnix toolset, which provides system administrators or developers with automatic deployment of a distributed system in a network of machines from declarative specifications and offers properties such as complete dependencies, atomic upgrades and rollbacks to make this process efficient and reliable. Disnix has an extensible architecture, allowing the integration of custom modules to make the deployment more convenient and suitable for the domain in which the system is to be used. Disnix has been under development for almost four years and has been applied to several types of distributed systems, including an industrial case study. },

  Abstract                 = {In a recent paper Baier et al. [Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, 2000, p. 358] analyzed a new way of model-checking formulas of a logic for continuous-time processesâ€”called continuous stochastic logic (henceforth CSL)â€”against continuous-time Markov chainsâ€”henceforth CTMCs. One of the important results of that paper was the proof that if two \{CTMCs\} were bisimilar then they would satisfy exactly the same formulas of CSL. This raises the converse questionâ€”does satisfaction of the same collection of \{CSL\} formulas imply bisimilarity? In other words, given two \{CTMCs\} which are known to satisfy exactly the same formulas of \{CSL\} does it have to be the case that they are bisimilar? We prove that the answer to the question just raised is â€œyesâ€�. In fact we prove a significant extension, namely that a subset of \{CSL\} suffices even for systems where the state space may be a continuum. Along the way we prove a result to the effect that the set of Zeno paths has measure zero provided that the transition rates are bounded. },

  Abstract                 = {Modern software-intensive systems often interact with an environment whose behavior changes over time, often unpredictably. The occurrence of changes may jeopardize their ability to meet the desired requirements. It is therefore desirable to design software in a way that it can self-adapt to the occurrence of changes with limited, or even without, human intervention. Self-adaptation can be achieved by bringing software models and model checking to run time, to support perpetual automatic reasoning about changes. Once a change is detected, the system itself can predict if requirements violations may occur and enable appropriate counter-actions. However, existing mainstream model checking techniques and tools were not conceived for run-time usage; hence they hardly meet the constraints imposed by on-the-fly analysis in terms of execution time and memory usage. This paper addresses this issue and focuses on perpetual satisfaction of non-functional requirements, such as reliability or energy consumption. Its main contribution is the description of a mathematical framework for run-time efficient probabilistic model checking. Our approach statically generates a set of verification conditions that can be efficiently evaluated at run time as soon as changes occur. The proposed approach also supports sensitivity analysis, which enables reasoning about the effects of changes and can drive effective adaptation strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper highlights a promising application of the analysis technique of probabilistic verification. We prove that it is able and suitable to analyse \{GNSS\} based positioning in aviation sectors for aircraft guidance. In particular, the focus is a widely used formal method called probabilistic model checking, and its generalisation to the analysis of quantitative aspects of a specific civil flight. We construct a formal model of the \{GNSS\} based positioning system for this application in the probabilistic Ï€-calculus, a process algebra which supports modelling of concurrency, uncertainty, and mobility. After that, we encode our model in language of the \{PRISM\} symbolic probabilistic model checker. We then formalise and analyse the logical properties that relate to the dependability of the underlying system to check the system reliability and availability. We demonstrate how model specification and verification techniques can be successfully applied to the reliability and availability analysis of our case study. },

  Abstract                 = {One of the crucial aspects that influence reliability of embedded systems is the deployment of software components to hardware nodes. If the hardware architecture is designed prior to the customized software architecture, which is often the case in product-line manufacturing (e.g. in the automotive domain), the system architect needs to resolve a nontrivial task of finding a (near-)optimal deployment balancing the reliabilities of individual services implemented on the software level.In this paper, we introduce an approach to automate this task. As distinct to related approaches, which typically stay with quantification of reliability for a specific deployment, we target multi-criteria optimization and provide the architect with near-optimal (non-dominated) deployment alternatives with respect to service reliabilities.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract SysML activity diagrams are OMG/INCOSE standard diagrams used for modeling and specifying probabilistic systems. They support systems composition by call behavior and send/receive artifacts. For verification, the existing approaches dedicated to these diagrams are limited to a restricted set of artifacts. In this paper, we propose a formal verification framework for these diagrams that supports the most important artifacts. It is based on mapping a composition of SysML activity diagrams to the input language of the probabilistic symbolic model checker called â€œPRISMâ€�. To prove the soundness of our mapping approach, we capture the underlying semantics of both the SysML activity diagrams and their generated \{PRISM\} code. We found that the probabilistic equivalence relation between both semantics preserve the satisfaction of the system requirements. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting real case studies. },

Intermittent hardware errors are non-deterministic bursts of errors that occur in the same physical location. Recent studies have found that 40% of the processor failures in real-world machines are due to intermittent hardware errors. A study of the effects of intermittent faults on programs is a critical step in building fault-tolerance techniques of reasonable accuracy and cost. In this work, we characterize the impact of intermittent hardware faults in programs using fault-injection campaigns in a microarchitectural processor simulator. We find that 80% of the non-benign intermittent hardware errors activate a hardware trap in the processor, and the remaining 20% cause silent data corruptions. We have also investigated the possibility of using the program state at failure time in software-based diagnosis techniques, and found that much of the erroneous data are intact and can be used to identify the source of the error.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Contemporary motor vehicles have increasing numbers of automated functions to augment the safety and comfort of a car. The automotive industry has to incorporate increasing numbers of processing units in the structure of cars to run the software that provides these functionalities. The software components often need access to sensors or mechanical devices which they are designed to operate. The result is a network of hardware units which can accommodate a limited number of software programs, each of which has to be assigned to a hardware unit. A prime goal of this deployment problem is to find software-to-hardware assignments that maximise the reliability of the system. In doing so, the assignments have to observe a number of constraints to be viable. This includes limited memory of a hardware unit, collocation of software components on the same hardware units, and communication between software components. Since the problem consists of many constraints with a significantly large search space, we investigate an \{ACO\} and constraint programming (CP) hybrid for this problem. We find that despite the large number of constraints, \{ACO\} on its own is the most effective method providing good solutions by also exploring infeasible regions. },

    Abstract = {In this paper, we present DeployWare to address the deployment of distributed and heterogeneous software systems on large scale infrastructures such as grids. Deployment of software systems on grids raises many challenges like 1) the complexity to take into account orchestration of all the deployment tasks and management of software dependencies, 2) the heterogeneity of both physical infrastructures and software composing the system to deploy, 3) the validation to early detect errors before concrete deployments and 4) scalability to tackle thousands of nodes. To address these challenges, DeployWare provides a metamodel that abstracts concepts of the deployment, a virtual machine that executes deployment processes on grids from DeployWare descriptions, and a graphical console that allows to manage deployed systems, at runtime. To validate our approach, we have experimented DeployWare with a lot of software technologies, such as CORBA and SOA-based systems, on one thousand of nodes of Grid'5000, the french experimental grid infrastructure.},

    Abstract = {In this paper, we present a two-phase design space exploration (DSE) approach to address the problem of real-time application mapping on a flexible MPSoC platform. Our approach is composed of two independent phases – analytical estimation/pruning and system simulation – communicating via a well-defined interface. The strength of the resulting strategy is twofold. On one hand, it is capable of combining the benefits of analytical models and simulation tools (i.e., speed and accuracy). And on the other hand, separating pruning and evaluation phases facilitates the integration of different or additional pruning techniques as well as other existing simulation tools. Finally, we also present several proof-of-concept DSE experiments to illustrate distinct aspects and capabilities of our framework. These experimental results reveal that our approach, compared to other approaches based only on analytical estimation models or simulations guided by e.g. genetic algorithms, not only can explore a large design space and reach a valid solution in a time-efficient way, but also can provide solutions optimizing resource usage efficiency, system traffic and processor load balancing.},
